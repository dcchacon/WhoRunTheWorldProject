Story:
People living in households in the US that have an income level below the Federal poverty threshold have more than double the rates of violent victimization compared to individuals in high-income households.

Urban poverty increased the risks of violence and crime for US households.

L.A.'s crime rise is no surprise. Los Angeles is one of the biggest cities in the US with one of the highest poverty rates in California. Poor areas precipitate more crime.
